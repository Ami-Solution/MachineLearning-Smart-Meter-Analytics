This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks of the intriguing physical constants ratios that are at play in Advanced Metering Infrstructure Analytics of [*Jupyter-Notebook-MachineLearning-Smart-Meter-Analytics(2018)*](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-smart-meter/-first-e/ https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/), by Ami-Solution, *Packt Publishing*.

This repository is read-only: the source files are on the [Jupyter-Notebook-MachineLearning-Smart-Meter-Analytics](https://github.com/Ami-Solution/MachineLearning-Smart-Meter-Analytics) repository.


## Running the code in the cloud

With [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), you can run most of the Jupyter notebooks directly from your web browser without installing anything. Just click on the `launch binder` button above. A temporary Jupyter Notebook server with all dependencies will be automatically launched in the cloud. It is not persistent: all your changes will be lost after some time.
